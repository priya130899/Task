In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental data type and one of the core building blocks of the language. They are used to represent and store collections of data and functionality. Here's a comprehensive overview of objects in JavaScript:

1.Object Basics:

    An object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. The keys are typically strings (or symbols in modern JavaScript), and the values can be of any data type, including other objects.
Objects can represent real-world entities, abstract concepts, or structured data.
javascript

example:
    // Object created using an object literal
    const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30
    };

2.Properties:

    Objects have properties, which are the key-value pairs that define the object's characteristics or attributes.
Properties can be accessed using dot notation or square bracket notation.
javascript

example:
    console.log(person.firstName); // "John"
    console.log(person["lastName"]); // "Doe"

3.Methods:

    Objects can contain functions as properties, which are known as methods. Methods encapsulate behavior associated with the object.
javascript

example:
    const calculator = {
    add: function (a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};
console.log(calculator.add(5, 3)); // 8

4.Object Creation:

==>Objects can be created using various methods, including:
    *Object literals: const person = { /* properties */ };
    *Constructors: function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
    *ES6 Classes: class Animal { constructor(name) { this.name = name; } }

5.Prototypes and Inheritance:

    JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects, known as their prototypes.
You can set an object's prototype using Object.create() or by defining a prototype property in constructor functions.
javascript

example:
    function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    Person.prototype.greet = function () {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    };

    const john = new Person("John");
    john.greet(); // "Hello, my name is John"

6.Object Manipulation:

    Properties of an object can be added, modified, or deleted dynamically.
The for...in loop is commonly used to iterate over an object's properties.
javascript

example:
    // Adding a property
    person.email = "john@example.com";

    // Modifying a property
    person.age = 31;

    // Deleting a property
    delete person.age;

O7.bject Methods:

    JavaScript provides several built-in methods for working with objects, such as Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries(), which allow you to work with an object's properties and values.
javascript

example:
    const keys = Object.keys(person);
    const values = Object.values(person);
    const entries = Object.entries(person);
Objects are a versatile and powerful feature of JavaScript, allowing you to represent and work with complex data structures and behaviors
